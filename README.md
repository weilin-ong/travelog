Travker is your personal digital world map where you can pin-point all the places you've travelled to. 

1. Leveraging the power of Google Map api, for any place you find there, you can find it on TravKer too!
2. You are not only dropping a pin on Map, but also logging your travel details such as Date, Pictures (max. 4), Ratings and Comments so that you can always click on the pin and review your travel moments.
3. You can add as many pins as you like, edit and delete the pin as you wish.
